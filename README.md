## Technical Background
I have a pretty good amount of coding experience. I dual-enrolled at Hope College during my highschool Junior year while also being on our school's robotic's team.
During that time I gained a lot of experience in Java as well as some experience in languages like Python, C#, C, html, and using the linux terminal.
